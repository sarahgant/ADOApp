  - Calculates story points completed per actual sprint
  - Uses rolling average of last 6 sprints for stable and representative velocity
  - Fallback mechanism when iteration data is unavailable
  - Aligns with true agile velocity practices
- **✅ Velocity Tooltip Added** - Explains the sprint-based calculation method
- **✅ Scope Tracking Enhancement** - Added assigned vs completed tracking:
  - Story Points: Shows "completed/assigned" instead of "completed/total"
  - Items Scope: Shows "completed items/assigned items" for better throughput visibility
- **✅ Rejection Rate Accuracy** - Now tracks items that moved to rework board columns:
  - Monitors board columns containing "rework", "returned", "failed"
  - Also checks for rejection states like "Rejected", "Returned", "Failed Review"
  - More accurate measure of quality issues requiring rework
- **✅ UI Cleanup** - Removed duplicate filters section for cleaner interface
- **✅ Bug Ratio Tooltip Fix** - Fixed tooltip showing story points instead of work items count
- **✅ Rejection Rate Tooltip Added** - Added missing tooltip with clear explanation

  - Red: >30% (bad quality)
  - Yellow: 15-30% (needs attention)  
  - Green: ≤15% (good quality)

### Calculation Verification ✅ TRIPLE-CHECKED
**Velocity Calculation - NOW ACCURATE** ✅:
- **Sprint-Based**: Groups completed items by Azure DevOps iteration paths
- **Rolling Average**: Uses last 6 sprints maximum for stable velocity measurement
- **Real Sprint Data**: No more hardcoded assumptions about sprint length
- **Agile Compliant**: Aligns with standard agile velocity practices
- **Fallback**: Simple calculation when iteration data unavailable

**Bug Ratio Calculation - CORRECT**:
- Primary: `(bugs found as children of user stories / user stories count) × 100`
- Fallback: `(bugs directly assigned / total work items) × 100`
- Uses work item counts, NOT story points ✅

**Rejection Rate Calculation - CORRECT**:
- `(items moved to rework / total assigned items) × 100`
- Tracks both board column movements and state changes ✅

**Scope Tracking - CORRECT**:
- Shows assigned vs completed for both items and story points
- Provides clear visibility into throughput and capacity ✅

### Key Metrics Now Accurately Tracked
- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint (2-week periods) - FIXED ✅
- **Scope Tracking**: Assigned vs completed items and story points - NEW ✅  
- **Bug Ratio**: Percentage of user stories that generated child bugs - ACCURATE ✅
- **Rejection Rate**: Items moved to rework board columns - ACCURATE ✅
- **Throughput**: Completed work items per developer
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of assigned work completed
- **Cycle Time**: Average time from activation to completion
- **Active Work**: Current in-progress items per developer

### Improved User Experience
- **Single Filter Interface**: Removed duplicate filters, kept only header filters
- **Better Scope Visibility**: Clear assigned vs completed ratios
- **Accurate Quality Metrics**: Both bug ratio and rejection rate now use proper data sources
- **Sprint-Based Velocity**: More meaningful velocity calculation aligned with agile practices

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Velocity**: `completedStoryPoints / sprintsInPeriod` (2-week sprints)
- **Rejection Rate**: Checks both board columns and states for rework indicators
- **Scope Tracking**: Added `assignedItems` and `assignedStoryPoints` fields to interface
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed redundant TeamFilters component from main content area

The Team Analytics page now provides industry-standard, accurate metrics that align with agile development practices and give meaningful insights into team performance and code quality.

## Next Steps
