# Project Tasks

This document outlines the development tasks for the ADO Dashboard API project.

## Feature: Sprint Configuration
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to configure the sprint length and the start date of our first sprint, so that the dashboard can accurately calculate current sprint metrics, days remaining, and other sprint-related data.
- **Tasks:**
    - [ ] Create a settings UI (modal or page) with inputs for "Sprint Length (in weeks)" and "First Sprint Start Date".
    - [ ] Implement a `settingsService` to save these values to `localStorage`.
    - [ ] Implement a `sprintService` to perform calculations based on the saved settings.
        - Calculate current sprint number.
        - Calculate days remaining in the current sprint.
        - Calculate start and end dates of the current sprint.
    - [ ] Write unit tests for `sprintService` to cover all calculation logic.
    - [ ] Integrate the sprint information into the main dashboard view.

## Feature: Team Member Filtering
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to select or deselect team members from a list, so that all dashboard calculations and visualizations are dynamically updated to reflect only the chosen members.
- **Tasks:**
    - [ ] Add checkboxes next to each team member in the UI.
    - [ ] Add "Select All" / "Deselect All" functionality.
    - [ ] Implement state management to track selected members.
    - [ ] Save the selection to `localStorage` to persist between sessions.
    - [ ] Create/update a `teamDataService` to filter the main dataset based on the selection.
    - [ ] Write unit and integration tests for the filtering logic.

## Feature: In-depth Analysis
- **User Story:** As a user, I want access to more advanced analytics to gain deeper insights into my team's performance and processes.
- **Tasks:**
    - [ ] **Individual Performance Dashboard:**
        - [ ] Design and build a view for individual trend analysis (tasks, story points).
        - [ ] Implement work breakdown visualization (pie chart).
        - [ ] Add comparison metrics against the team average.
    - [ ] **Sprint-over-Sprint Trend Analysis:**
        - [ ] Create a UI to select multiple sprints for comparison.
        - [ ] Visualize comparative metrics (Velocity, Cycle Time, etc.) using bar charts.
    - [ ] **Work Item Flow Analysis:**
        - [ ] Implement a Cumulative Flow Diagram.
        - [ ] Develop logic to identify and flag stale/stuck work items.
        - [ ] Calculate and display the average time spent in each workflow stage.
    - [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all new analysis components and logic.
